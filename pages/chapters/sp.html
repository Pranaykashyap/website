        <p>I am humbled by the opportunity to serve as Faculty advisor of the IEEE Signal Processing Society student chapter; one of the largest, most vibrant, and also oldest IEEE Society.  We are blessed with many dedicated volunteers who care deeply about our discipline, its standing, and contributions in a fast-changing environment
The technology we use, and even rely on, in our everyday lives –computers, radios, video, cell phones – is enabled by signal processing, a branch of electrical engineering that models and analyzes data representations of physical events. Signal processing is at the heart of our modern world, powering today’s entertainment and tomorrow’s technology. It’s at the intersection of biotechnology and social interactions. It enhances our ability to communicate and share information. Signal processing is the science behind our digital lives. Recently, machine learning techniques have been applied to aspects of signal processing, blurring the lines between the sciences, and causing many shared applications between the two.
As Faculty Advisor for the IEEE Signal Processing society student chapter of VCE, I welcome you to the IEEE Family. Needless to state that this platform shall be just a beginning to connect to the hundreds of your colleagues from the fraternity of Electrical, Electronics & allied areas. The IEEE SP Student chapter initiated with a promise to promote excellence amongst the students of the associated fields, shall strive at its level best to ensure a smooth transition of a student into able & qualified Engineers contributing towards the well being of the society.
The Signal Processing society student chapter is committed to organize events for the overall growth and development of the students and shall continue to work in the same direction
My heartily congratulations to all the students who have chosen to be IEEE members and wish them all success for their future endeavors.</p>
        <p>- Dr. G. A. E. Satish Kumar,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IEEE SP & COMSOC, Student Chapter Advisor, Vardhaman College of Engineering.</p>
